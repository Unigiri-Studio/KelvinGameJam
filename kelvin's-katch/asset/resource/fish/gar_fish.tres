fun_fact = "Gar fish are ancient, dating back over 100 million years, and have long, slender bodies with armor-like scales. They have a distinctive, needle-like snout filled with sharp teeth, perfect for catching prey. Gars can survive in low-oxygen water by breathing air, thanks to a specialized swim bladder that functions like a lung, setting them apart from most fish."
