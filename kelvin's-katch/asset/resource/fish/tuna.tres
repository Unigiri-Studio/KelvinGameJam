fun_fact = "Tuna are incredible swimmers, reaching speeds of up to 43 miles per hour! Unlike most fish, they are warm-blooded, which helps them thrive in diverse ocean temperatures. Tuna also migrate thousands of miles annually and can dive up to 3,000 feet. Their muscular bodies and streamlined shape make them one of the ocean’s top predators."
