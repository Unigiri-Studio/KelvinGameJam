fun_fact = "Wrasses are colorful, clever reef fish known for their cleaning skills! Certain species, like the cleaner wrasse, help other fish by eating parasites off their scales. They can change color, sex, and even shape to adapt to their social environment. With over 600 species, wrasses are key to coral reef health and fascinating for their unique behaviors."
