fun_fact = "Flounders are fascinating fish with a unique adaptation: they start life with eyes on both sides of their head, but as they mature, one eye migrates to join the other! This helps them lie flat and camouflage on the ocean floor. Their color-changing ability allows them to blend into their surroundings, making them expert ambush predators."
