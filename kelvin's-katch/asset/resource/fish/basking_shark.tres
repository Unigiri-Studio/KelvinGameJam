fun_fact = "Basking sharks are the second-largest fish in the world, reaching lengths of up to 12 meters (39 feet). Despite their size, they're gentle giants, feeding only on plankton! To do this, they swim with their massive mouths wide open, filtering up to 2,000 tons of water per hour through their gill rakers to capture tiny plankton."
