fun_fact = "Whiting are small, slender fish known for their delicate, white flesh and mild flavor. They play an important role in marine ecosystems, feeding on crustaceans and small fish while being prey for larger species. Whiting can change color slightly to blend with the seabed, helping them avoid predators. They're popular in European cuisine, often enjoyed fried or baked."
